## Problem

Modern professionals encounter an overwhelming volume of AI tools and terminology. The core problem is not evaluation or recommendation—it is basic recognition and recall. People regularly ask "What is this thing I just heard about?" Existing resources either over-prescribe judgment or collapse into messy bookmarks.

## Solution

A single, reliable catalog that captures tools and terms a serious professional might plausibly encounter, without implying quality, endorsement, or relevance. Descriptive, not prescriptive.

## Target Customer

Smart, motivated professionals who encounter AI/productivity/business tools in their work and need a neutral reference to answer "What the hell is this?"

## Core Object: Catalog Entry

Each entry captures exactly four attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Name** | The commonly used name. No renaming or branding spin. |
| **Description** | One plain-language sentence explaining what it is. Boring and clear beats clever. |
| **In Current Stack** | Yes/No — Whether actively part of the creator's working setup. |
| **Pressure-Tested** | Yes/No — Whether used in real work with real stakes (not demos, reading, or hype exposure). |

## Inclusion Rule

An item belongs in the catalog if:

> "A smart, motivated professional could reasonably encounter this in the wild."

Inclusion does **NOT** imply: quality, usefulness, endorsement, relevance, or longevity.

## Non-Goals (Explicit)

- No recommendations
- No rankings or ratings
- No lifecycle management (active/defunct)
- No teaching, learning paths, or certification logic
- No canon or omakase curation (yet)

## Editorial Stance

- Descriptive, not prescriptive
- Records exposure and experience, not judgment
- Judgment intentionally deferred to future layers
- Every description must be something the author could say aloud to a respected peer without embarrassment
- Marketing language, hype, and borrowed jargon are grounds for rewriting

## Intended Outcomes

The catalog functions as:
- A personal and shared lexicon
- A memory aid
- A neutral reference
- A foundation for future comparison, curation, and learning layers

## Success Criteria (v0)

If someone asks "What the hell is this?", the catalog answers clearly, simply, and without opinion.

## Why Now

The AI tool landscape is expanding faster than memory can track. The professional need for a neutral "what is this" reference is immediate and growing.

## Risks & Open Questions

- Scope creep toward recommendations or ratings
- Maintaining editorial discipline as catalog grows
- Deciding where the boundary is for "reasonably encounter in the wild"
